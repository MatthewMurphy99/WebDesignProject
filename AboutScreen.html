        <h2>Brief history on ERC</h2>
            <p>Enniskillen Running Club was founded in 2010 by a group of runners from the town, and surrounding areas who wanted to meet up reguarly. Since then the club has gone from strength to strength with a lot of success along the way. Originally a club just for seniors, the club now has a junior section, facilitating both primary and secondary level children. The club has had athletes selected to represent N. Ireland and Ireland in international competition as well, highlighting how far the club has come in their decade of existence.</p>
